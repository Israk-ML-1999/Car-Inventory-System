# Car Inventory System

## Introduction

The Car Inventory System is a basic web application that allows users to enter information about electric and gas cars. The system uses an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach with classes like Car, ElectricCar, and GasCar. The entered data is stored in a SQLite database, and a DataTable is used to display the list of cars on the web page.

## Features

- Add new cars to the inventory with details such as name, model, year, and additional information based on the car type (Electric or Gas).
- Store car information in a SQLite database.
- Display a neat tabular view of the car inventory using DataTables.
- Simple and clean user interface with Bootstrap.

- `templates/`: Folder containing HTML templates for the web pages.
  - `index.html`: Template for displaying the list of cars.
  - `add_car.html`: Template for the form to add new cars.
